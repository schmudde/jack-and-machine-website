<h1>Contributing</h1>

<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest in Parsley and your will to contribute. You're welcome!</p>

<p>First thing: make sure you are using the <strong>latest official release</strong>.</p>

<h2>Questions?</h2>

<p>Please ask questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">StackOverflow</a> and be sure to include the <code>parsley.js</code> tag. Please <strong>provide an example</strong>, starting for example from <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/marcandre/58vnaqur/">this jsfiddle</a></p>

<h2>Issues?</h2>

<p>If you believe you have found a bug in <code>parsley</code>, please <strong>provide an example</strong>, starting for example from <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/marcandre/58vnaqur/">this jsfiddle</a>.</p>

<p>This makes it possible for you to be sure you have isolated the issue to a minimal case. It also makes it much easier for us to understand your issue. Sometimes the issue is <a href="https://github.com/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js/issues/711">completely different than what you would expect</a> and only an actual example can lead to a solution.</p>

<h2>Pull requests?</h2>

<p>Here are a few simple rules you'll have to follow in order to ease code reviews,
discussions and PR merging.</p>

<p>1) You MUST follow Parsley coding standard. It basically follows
<a href="http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention#javascript">these popular rules</a> except that
functions are followed by one space on Parsley. Use two spaces as tabs.</p>

<p>2) You MUST write / update tests for each code contribution you do</p>

<p>3) You MUST commit a passing test-suite</p>

<p>4) You SHOULD write documentation</p>

<p>Please, write <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">commit messages that make
sense</a>,
and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing">rebase your branch</a>
before submitting your Pull Request.</p>

<p>One may ask you to <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html">squash your
commits</a>
too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want
commits such as <code>fix tests</code>, <code>fix 2</code>, <code>fix 3</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description
which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
